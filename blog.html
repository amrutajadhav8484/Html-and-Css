      <h3>Hardik Pandya</h3>
      <p>Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia,
         before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He
          appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly 
          fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in India's squad for that year's T20 World Cup.</p>
